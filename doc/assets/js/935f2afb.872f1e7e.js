It is typically a Wallet that wants to synchronize with the Cardano blockchain. When performed from the begining of the chain, it can take several days to compute all the blocks and verify everything is consistent. Snapshots act as certified savepoints, the wallet can assume all the blocks in the snapshots are consistent hence only the newer blocks are to be verified. This dramatically reduces the synchronization times.","sidebar":"docSideBar"},"manual/developer-docs/architecture/signer":{"id":"manual/developer-docs/architecture/signer","title":"Mithril Signer Node","description":"A Signer is a participant to a Mithril Multisignature. As such, a signer contributes to signing an expected genuine message. To do so, the signer computes the digest from the information stored on a Cardano node and signs it with his secret key. This signed message is sent to the Aggregator, along with the corresponding won lottery numbers. This way, the Aggregator can assess that the Signer is identified and has signed the same message.","sidebar":"docSideBar"},"manual/developer-docs/references":{"id":"manual/developer-docs/references","title":"API References","description":"Welcome to the Mithril references docs!","sidebar":"docSideBar"},"manual/getting-started/bootstrap-cardano-node":{"id":"manual/getting-started/bootstrap-cardano-node","title":"Bootstrap a Cardano Node","description":"Thanks to a Mithril Client connected to a Mithril Aggregator, you will restore a full Cardano node in less than 2 hours!","sidebar":"docSideBar"},"manual/getting-started/run-mithril-devnet":{"id":"manual/getting-started/run-mithril-devnet","title":"Run a Private Mithril network","description":"In this guide, you will learn how to run a demonstration of a Mithril Network working on top of a private devnet Cardano Network.
