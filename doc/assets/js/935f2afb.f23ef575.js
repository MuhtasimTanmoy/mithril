When performed from the begining of the chain, it can take several days to compute all the blocks and verify everything is consistent. Snapshots act as certified savepoints, the wallet can assume all the blocks in the snapshots are consistent hence only the newer blocks are to be verified.

This way, the Aggregator can assess that the Signer is identified and has signed the same message.","sidebar":"topologiesSidebar"}}}')}}]);
