This means that the [Mithril Explorer](https://mithril.network/explorer/) will display a `No snapshot available` message.\\n\\n* The Mithril Signers will have to wait until the next epoch `#30` to be able to sign. This means that we should see the first available `Snapshot` 1 hour after the epoch transition.\\n\\nThe SPOs that are currently running a Mithril Signer will have to recompile their node in order ot take advantage of the latest improvements (such as the registration of the nodes that will take few minutes instead of few hours). However, the previously compiled node will be able to contribute to signatures.\\n\\nIn order to restore a Mithril Snapshot, a Mithril Client will now need access to the `Genesis Verification Key` by adding an environment variable when running: `GENESIS_VERIFICATION_KEY=$(wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/input-output-hk/mithril/main/TEST_ONLY_genesis.vkey)`.\\n\\nFeel free to reach out to us on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/5kaErDKDRq) for questions and/or help."}]}')}}]);
